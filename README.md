CHALLENGE

Social Network For Competition

I developed CHALLENGE application on iOS that people can challenge with friends, themself or between teams. It is provide to people create challenges and complete it.  You can join trends, stalk others and proof themself. It is a competitive social media platform.

Now people can follow and support their favorite football team, tennis player, basketball player. Or if they canâ€™t motivate themself about gym, learning new language or discover new places, they can just create a challenge to themself and motivate themself with their friend supports. 

Some features we have developed are as follows. We are in search of an investor so that we can do more and deliver our application to people. I'm sharing the app's test flight address below so you can review it. If you are interested, my contact details are as follows.
